#Solution

The problem is called Julius Save Me. Since it's the first problem, and because the title says "Julius"
You should be thinking of a Caesar cipher right away.

The python program checks for all 26 possible shifts (the English alphabet has 26 letters...)
Just run it and you'll this line:

    julius caesar is the best but my friend likes napoleon better for whatever reason. oh well. the flag is easyctf{Nap0leon_vs_Ca3s4r}

Flag: **easyctf{Nap0leon_vs_Ca3s4r}**
