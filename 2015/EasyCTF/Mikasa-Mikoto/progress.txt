1) So we google Mikasa Mikoto, we get this

2) Under Epithet there's "railgun", I think this hints to rail-fence cipher,
So I go here:

3) Set the groups to 5 (her power level), paste this text

rasfsasrettlepinebec353luteayvlrghs3s

4) And click on decipher to get this:

railgunsarethebesteasyctfl3v3l5es

I tried submitting that whole string, as well as:
easyctfl3v3l5es
easyctf{l3v3l5es}
l3v3l5es
railgunsarethebesteasyctfl3v3l5es

None were the answer :/ but I'm pretty sure we're on the right track
