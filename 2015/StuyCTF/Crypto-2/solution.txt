So we're told the cipher text was encrypted with rot13. So we first use the .decode method
with rot13 as the parameter on the string provided to us. The string has an equal sign padding,
which often symbolizes base64 encryption. So this time we use .decode again but with base64 as
the parameter. Finally we print out the string after 2 decryption algorithms applied to it.

Flag: stuyctf{base64_is_fun}
