First off big thank you to team COmbustibleLemons.
They wrote a similar program for CTCTF and I recognized that the problems were similar.
I altered their code for the purposes of this task.
Basically we loop over the possible characters and check if the 
username: admin 's password begins and continues with the letters we're testing.
Eventually we get this string back, which is the flag.

Flag: stuyctf{passwords_shouldnt_be_flags_in_ctfs}
