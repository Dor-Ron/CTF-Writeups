Even though the problem suggests we usee netcat aka **nc** command for unix,
I like being difficult and used telnet instead.
Therefore, in terminal type **telnet stuyctf.me 11111**
and get back the message:
*Connected to stuyctf.me.
Escape character is '^]'.
stuyctf{yay_for_netcat!}
Connection closed by foreign host.*

Flag: stuyctf{yay_for_netcat!}
