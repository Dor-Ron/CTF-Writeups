I used urllib2 to get the content of the text file.
The words are split with a space character.
So I used the .split method with a space as its parameters to 
transform the long string into a list with each word as a separate index.
I then used the len() method to count the index's of the array.
And voila we get our flag printed in its format.

Flag: stuyctf{176945}
