I normally use a crytogram solver called quipquip for substitution ciphers.
It got the job done this time around as well.

Entering the text from the problem, the closest match was:

IO CRYPTOGRAPHY, A SUBSTITUTIOO CIPHER IS A METHOD OF EOCODIOG BY WHICH UOITS OF PLAIOTEXT ARE REPLACED WITH CIPHERTEXT, ACCORDIOG TO A REGULAR SYSTEM; THE 'UOITS' MAY BE SIOGLE LETTERS (THE MOST COMMOO), PAIRS OF LETTERS, TRIPLETS OF LETTERS, MIXTURES OF THE ABOVE, AOD SO FORTH. FOR THE FLAG, IT'S ~EEPITCLEAO

What we need is: FOR THE FLAG, IT'S ~EEPITCLEAO

~EEPITCLEAO looks reasonably similar to KEEPITCLEAN, which was the flag.

Flag: KEEPITCLEAN
