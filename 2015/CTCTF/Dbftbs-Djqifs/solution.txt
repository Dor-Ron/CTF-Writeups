The hint to the problem was step it up which was the flag to a previously solved problem.
In that problem we used a caesarian shift cipher, so we're gonna use it again here.
This time however instead of n = 25, n = 9.
Using this tool: http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/caesar.php
we can tell that the flag is:

Flag: captured_the_flag
