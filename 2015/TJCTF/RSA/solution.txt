We know to decrypt using RSA from the problem name.
We are given all the numbers we need, so we use the pow function
with c, d, and n as arguments. Which essentially does the following:
c ^ d % n

We then convert the number to a hexadecimal value and "asciify" it.

Flag: modular_arithmetic_is_cool!
