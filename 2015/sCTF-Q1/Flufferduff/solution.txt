Look at the python file.
Looking back there are betters way I could've wrote this.
Especially not dealing with all those arrays. But it works.
Made an array of prime and odd numbers below 1000.
Then wrote a function to get the sum of all the numbers in those array, 
in the range of the parameter (exclusive)

Finally, plugged it into the flufferduff equation and got the flag.

Flag: 991
