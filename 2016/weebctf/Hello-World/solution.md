# Hello, World? - 10, Solution

We are given what seems to be decimal values for what we think is the flag. You can use an online tool to convert them to their ASCII letter values, but I just wrote a small python script for the job.
Run it on the input and you'll get the flag.

Flag: **weeb{こんにちは}**
