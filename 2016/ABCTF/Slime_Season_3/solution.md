# Slime Season 3 - 60 Solution
---

I tried making a script to solve the problem, following what seemed the most logical way to me, subtracting the largest coin until the mean change was smaller than that and moving onto the next largest coin.

That program can be found in the **coins.py** file of the folder.

When that didn't work as planned yielding 7318 coins, I resorted to brute-forcing the correct amount of coins.
That file is named **slime.js** and can also be found in this folder.
