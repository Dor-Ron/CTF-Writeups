There are a few possible solutions to this one.

One is the Python approach:

  * `python` 
  * then in the REPL typing `open('"spaces in this filename').read()`
  
Then, you can realize that there is only one file in the directory and run:

`cat *`

Finally, the way they want you to do it....

`cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename`

Using the backslash as an escape character to the spaces in the filename.
