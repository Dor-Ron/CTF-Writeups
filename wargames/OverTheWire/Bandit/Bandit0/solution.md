We need a unix like terminal to use ssh since Windows doesn't natively support ssh yet.
On unix based systems we just open terminal, on windows try Cygwin or PuTTY.
We can see from the wikihow link in the problem description that to connect to a remote host using
ssh we need to follow the format:

**\<username\>@\<remote\>**

Luckily for us, the two criteria have already been supplied in the problems description.
So in terminal we enter the following.

`ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`

We are then prompted for a password, which again we are provided with, so we enter:

*bandit0*

Finally, we know we're successful after recieving the following message:

This is the OverTheWire game server. More information on http://www.overthewire.org/wargames

Please note that wargame usernames are no longer level<X>, but wargamename<X>
e.g. vortex4, semtex2, ...

Note: at this moment, blacksun is not available.

Welcome to the OverTheWire games machine!

If you find any problems, please report them to Steven on
irc.overthewire.org.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine holds several wargames. 
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ and /proc/ is disabled
  so that users can not snoop on eachother.

  Please play nice:
      
    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

      -m32                    compile for 32bit
      -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
      -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro 

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.
