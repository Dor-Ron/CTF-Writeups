We can immediately recognize the morse code cipher.
We use the first link above and get the follwing link when decrypted.

HTTP://TINYURL.COM/LINESANDDOTS

We go to that link and get this text.

We then use the Caesar cipher with n = 21 and get:

nice work! this cipher should be familiar to you, or maybe not. anyway, as a reward, have this flag. l1n3s_and_d0ts_t0_w0rdz

Flag: l1n3s_and_d0ts_t0_w0rdz
