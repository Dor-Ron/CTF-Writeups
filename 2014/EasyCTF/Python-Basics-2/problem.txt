You're faced with a control panel. 
There are some instructions left on a sign nearby on the wall: 
This machine generates random numbers that you can access through the variable args[0]. 
If the number is greater than or equal to 0 and less than 100, print hacks. 
If the number is greater than or equal to 100, print haxx. 
If the number is negative, print hakz. Use the IDE (Python Editor) to complete this problem.
