Ok, so now you know how to list files and read files... this is starting to sound more like a file manager you are familiar with, right? So what's left now? Searching.

Luckily, there's also a command for that: grep. You know the drill, read up on the command, and then solve the problem in /problems/grep.

The flag is the filename of the file containing the string yep!. All other files will contain the string nope!.
