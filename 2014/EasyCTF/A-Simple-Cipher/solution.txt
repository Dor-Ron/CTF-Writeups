I used: http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/caesar.php
to decrypt the Caesar cipher.

We know shift for all the numbers is the same, and this part of the string:
ZNK LRGM OY IGKYGX_OY_NUSK.

Looks fairly similar to:
The flag is xxxxxx_xx_xxxx

So from Z -> T there's a 20 letter shift. We set n = 20 and decrypt the text.

Flag: CAESAR_IS_HOME
