I tried saving the image with numerous different file extensions. .zip worked best.
We get a bunch of files and one that stands out called: whatAFineKeyThisIs
In this file, it says:

my favorite numbers are seven and three.
gaf cnrvp qnjkfs hz zfufqgffq

I tried looking into ciphers which take 2 keys, and found the Affine Cipher.
I used this website 

to decrypt the text "gaf cnrvp qnjkfs hz zfufqgffq" with keys 7 and 3 and got:

the lucky number is seventeen

I then look into file 17.SHORT.OUT. I tried ctrl+f key words like flag, key, solution, answer etc. and found:

ANSWER4Y0UREFF0RTSISC1PH3RSANDKRYPT0


Flag: C1PH3RSANDKRYPT0
